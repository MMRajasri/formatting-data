# formatting-data
Datashader turns your data into a plot using a five-step pipeline. The Datashader docs illustrate how the pipeline works in each of the steps — projection, aggregation, transformation, colormapping, and embedding.
Here you can format your data. I have build a code that would format the data fed to it by using datahader to generate an efficient result. All you have to do is give a set of data you wish to format.
